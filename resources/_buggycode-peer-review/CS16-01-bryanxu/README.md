# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS 16

## Contributed by Bryan Xu

### Programming question
Why am I getting some weird bugs in my code? When I try to print out my array, there's weird characters at the end

### Conceptual questions
When making a char[], can I directly treat it as a string, or are there differences between the two?
